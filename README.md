## Book List App!  
This App is a Book List that features functions like **Adding**, **Removing** books and saves it to Local Storage in the browser.  
You can input the **Title**, **Author** and write an unique **ID** for every book. It also verifies the data. This was made with only pure **vanilla JavaScript**!  
This is my first experience using JavaScript classes, I've always ignored this type of coding method, but i found it really useful to make your own object-like elements with custom methods and properties!
